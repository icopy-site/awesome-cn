## Awesome Functional Programming [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Based on the [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/) project

## What is this about?

On the last decade, functional programming has gained a new found power due to its
declarative characteristics which, some would say, are very effective for parallel computing
and for the whole usage of [Moores Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law).

This repo gathers some material on Functional Programming such as blog posts, papers, videos,
tools, etc. and also aims to clarify some of the theoretical subjects behind it.

### Blog posts
- [Personal thoughts on the current functional programming bandwagon](http://www.akitaonrails.com/2015/10/28/personal-thoughts-on-the-current-functional-programming-bandwagon) 
Despite the name, this post actually clarifies some baisc concepts on Functional Programming, explains some of the History of FP and the implementation of FPs features on imperative languages and talks about all the fuss on declarative programming and why it has become so popular in the last few years.
