> Awesome Tor is a curated list of resources, tools, and applications related to the Tor network.

> [!NOTE]
> This product is produced independently from the Tor® anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.

Tor is a free overlay network for enabling anonymous communication. Built on free and open-source software and more than seven thousand volunteer-operated relays worldwide, users can have their Internet traffic routed via a random path through the network.

Before you read, if you want to host a Snowflake bridge in your browser to help users in censored regions bypass censorship, [click here](https://polycarbohydrate.github.io/awesome-tor/selfhost-snowflake). Thank you.
