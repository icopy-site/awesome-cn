## Custom Agents

[Custom agents](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents) let you set up different AI personas in VS Code for specific dev roles (like security reviewer, planner, or architect), each with its own instructions, tools, and behavior. You can also use handoffs to move between these specialized agents in a guided workflow (e.g., planning → implementation → review) with relevant context carried over.

The built-in available custom agents are:

- Agent
- Ask
- Edit
- Plan
- AIAgentExpert
- Configure Custom Agents (create your own)

## Agent Skills

Agent Skills are portable, [open standard](https://agentskills.io/home), version-controlled folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and load on demand to do tasks more accurately and efficiently. They let agents gain domain expertise, new capabilities, and repeatable workflows—while making those same skills reusable across different compatible agent products and teams.

## How to Use

### Setup Copilot in VSCode

1. Hover over the Copilot icon in the Status Bar and select Set up Copilot.
2. Select **Sign in** to sign in to your GitHub account or **Use Copilot** if you're already signed in.

**Tip**: Read more about setting up [VS Code Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup).

### Setup Instructions

1. Create instruction files using the latest naming conventions:
    1. Workspace instructions (place `*.instructions.md` files in `.github/instructions/` directory).
    2. Workspace prompts (place `*.prompt.md` files in `.github/prompts/` directory).
    3. Workspace custom agents (place `*.agent.md` files in `.github/agents` directory).
    4. Workspace custom skills (skills are stored in directories with a `SKILL.md` file that defines the skill's behavior).
    5. Workspace single instruction (place `copilot-instructions.md` in `.github` directory).

#### File Types

##### Instruction Files

`.instructions.md` - Contextual instructions that apply to specific files or file types.

##### Prompt Files

`.prompt.md` - Reusable prompts for specific tasks or workflows.

##### Custom Agent Files

`.agent.md` - Predefined AI personas behavior in VS Code for specific dev roles.

##### Custom Agent Skills

`SKILLS.md` - Portable, version-controlled folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and load on demand.

##### Formatting

Use YAML front matter to specify metadata like `applyTo`, `mode`, and `description`.
