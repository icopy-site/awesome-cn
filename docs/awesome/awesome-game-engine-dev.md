## Awesome Game Engine Development [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme)

Curated list of resources related to the development of game engines (tools that improve and speed up game creation). Specifically toward the development of high-level, fully featured game engines (e.g., Godot / Unity).

This includes things typically not found in low-level game engines, app / game frameworks, or graphics libraries (e.g., MonoGame / SDL). Most importantly of which would be a visual scene editor, but also capabilities like scripting, physics, asset management, special effects, monetization, etc.
