## Docs

FFmpeg's official docs are notoriously difficult for beginners to understand due to the scope and complexity of FFmpeg's capabilities. With that being said, they're still very useful as a reference.

- [FFmpeg.org](http://ffmpeg.org) - Where it all starts.
- [Filters](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html) - Docs for FFmpeg's powerful filter chains (scaling, cropping, concatenating, merging, etc.). This is one of my most visited links when working with FFmpeg.
- [Man page](https://man.cx/ffmpeg) - Official FFmpeg man page.
- [Wiki & Bug Tracker](https://trac.ffmpeg.org) - Lots of great info on here.
- [CLI flags](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/ffmpeg-cli-flags/blob/master/readme.md) - A comprehensive list of all FFmpeg commandline flags. Really useful for searching random flags that you come across in the wild.
