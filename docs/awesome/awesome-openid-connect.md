## Awesome OpenID Connect [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/#introduction) is an authentication protocol and identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0 used in many SSO and adopted in many social logins (Apple, Facebook, Google, etc). Basically, it allows a user to authenticate to a service using an existing account from an OpenID Connect Provider (OP), sharing some identity information after the user consent, and get an access token to access resources on a Relying Party (RP) application.

> Find this curated list of providers, services, libraries, and resources to adopt it and know more about existing and draft specs.
