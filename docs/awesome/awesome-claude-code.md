## [Awesome Claude Code](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code) 🤝 [Awesome Claude Code Agents](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code-agents)

<!--lint enable remark-lint:awesome-badge-->

<!--lint disable double-link-->

This is a curated list of slash-commands, `CLAUDE.md` files, CLI tools, and other resources and guides for enhancing your [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) workflow, productivity, and vibes.

<!--lint enable double-link-->

Claude Code is a cutting-edge CLI-based coding assistant and agent that you can access in your terminal or IDE. It is a rapidly evolving tool that offers a number of powerful capabilities, and allows for a lot of configuration, in a lot of different ways. Users are actively working out best practices and workflows. It is the hope that this repo will help the community share knowledge and understand how to get the most out of Claude Code.

### Announcements

- 2025-07-26 - Anthropic done done it again, and Claude Code now has another super-power in its arsenal - custom user Sub Agents! I was thinking I might add a little section at the bottom about this "agent" thing, but then I tried it, and I think they're amazing, and probably deserve their own repo, so come and check out [awesome-claude-code-agents](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code-agents) and get those submissions rolling in. Can't wait to see what people are getting up to already with this new tech.
- 2025-07-25 - The new-new submission workflow is up now, I've managed to make it about 4-5 times more complicated than it should be 😜 so check out [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/blob/master/../CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to submit a new resource.
