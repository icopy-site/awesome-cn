    - Thank you, again, to Anthropic PBC for paying tribute to hip-hop royalty in their recent advertising campaign. Although they neglected to include his voice in the commercial, I'm sure DOOM would have echoed their joyful sentiment with full enthusiasm.

    <summary>Content update</summary>

    - Thanks to the hard work that so many people have devoted to writing code for other users of Claude Code, the current list has reached a very respectable size, with about 150 resource listings. As Claude Code has now reached 2nd grade, I am thinking more about how best to manage the list going forward. First, I'd like to ensure that existing resources are still relevant and compatible with the current version of Claude Code. I think some categories (I'm thinking in particular of usage monitors and bespoke orchestration frameworks) are more or less at capacity. For those wishing to submit to the Awesome List, I would like to strongly encourage exploration of any new or recent features that have been, or will be, rolled out - and to think about how to creatively leverage the existing features of _Claude Code_, as opposed to finding new ways to hook up Claude Code to something _else_. (For a bit more detail, see <a href="./DONTREADME.md">`DONTREADME.md`</a>.) In addition to this, due to personal factors and social ailments such as "rent", I must be mindful of the time I devote to this project, which is non-trivial - and, sadly, because GitHub is not as cool as reddit, I operate at a loss in maintaining this repo. For now, I am temporarily suspending any commitment to maintaining the Issue submissions as a FIFO _queue_ of items that must be evaluated in a timely fashion. You are absolutely encouraged to submit your projects, and I respect everybody's hard work and will make my best effort to review submissions as they come in. Futher maintenance support may be coming soon, but until then, I will be adding items as I see fit, whether they are from the Issues list or those that I discover on my own. If you want to support more activate maintenance and attention towards reviewing submissions, you may see the <a href="#support">Support</a> section below. Frankly, everyone on the list probably deserves some compensation for helping make Claude Code such a popular and awesome product, but I don't control the purse strings.

## **Support**

You can easily offer support by making a charitable donation in honor of Awesome Claude Code by visiting the [fundraising page](https://donor.bailproject.org/-/NPHKDQGP/join?member=SELFZPZN) I've set up for [The Bail Project](https://bailproject.org/). One click will take you straight to the donation widget, and a few seconds later your contribution will be completed - even $1 will truly make an impact. (If you are on GitHub, and you want your donation to be recognized, you will have to take about two more minutes to complete a follow-up email which actually notifies me of the dedication. As a reward you can show one of our nice Freedom Funder badges.) Sadly, this repo cannot be actively maintained without some direct support to this fund. Luckily there are loads of other resources devoted to Claude and his amazing Code, and it's up to you whether you think this one is particularly valuable or not.

### 🚀 **[Submit a new resource here!](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/issues/new?template=submit-resource.yml)**

It's easy! Just click the link above and fill out the form. No Git knowledge required - our automated system handles everything for you.

**How we evaluate submissions**

- First and foremost, best efforts are made to ensure that any resource on this list is free of malware, bloatware, or other unwanted risks.
- Second, being a _curated_ list, every entry is manually evaluated and "tested out" to see if it actually delivers value to Claude Code users. If you want an _un-curated_ list, you can find many great resources [here](https://github.com/search?q=%22claude+code%22&type=repositories&s=stars&o=desc).

**What we're looking for**

- The Claude Code CLI/TUI has led the way in terms of its capabilities, range of features, and possibilites for configuration and optimization. As of late, many submissions have focused less on "what can you do with Claude Code?" and more on "how can I plug Claude Code in to 100 other cool things?" My goal is to focus on the former question, not because it's inherently more interesting, but because the internet is full of awesome things, and this particular repo is supposed to highlight awesome things you can do _with Claude Code_. That is to say, this is not a list for _general-purpose agent-configuration systems_ (however amazing those things are) - there are still plenty of people who sign up every day and go online and ask "What am I supposed to write in my `CLAUDE.md`"? Indie developers, such as those featured on this list, have often done much of the legwork to help those users get comfortable with the Claude Code ecosystem. So I encourage you to **keep exploring the possibilities that exist within Claude Code** - a small utility that is easy to install, easy to uninstall, and adds a dash of pleasure to the Claude Code experience, is more likely to be featured (or, more quickly, at least), than a full-fledged agent development framework that is more complex that Claude Code itself.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/blob/master//CONTRIBUTING.md) for the complete submission guide and review process.

For suggestions about the repository itself, please [open a general issue](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/issues/new).

This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/blob/master//code-of-conduct.md). By participating, you agree to abide by its terms. And although I take strong measures to uphold the quality and safety of this list, like Anthropic, I take no responsibility or liability for anything bad that might happen as a result of these third-party resources.
