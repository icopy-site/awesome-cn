## Awesome Empirical Software Engineering [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
A curated repository of data sets and tools that can be used for conducting evidence-based, data-driven research on software systems.
This research approach is often termed [experimental, or empirical software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_software_engineering).
Many of the data sets can also be useful in research using [search-based software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search-based_software_engineering) methods.
The repository is named after the [Mining Software Repositories (MSR)](https://www.msrconf.org/) conference series.
For examples of such work see the MSR conference's [Hall of Fame](http://2016.msrconf.org/#/hall-of-fame).
