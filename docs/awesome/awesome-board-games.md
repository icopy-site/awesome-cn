> Dune: Imperium uses deck-building to add a hidden-information angle to traditional worker placement. You start with a unique leader card, as well as a deck identical to those of your opponents. As you acquire cards and build your deck, your choices will define your strengths and weaknesses. Cards allow you to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board, so how your deck evolves affects your strategy.

### [Jungle Speed](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8098/jungle-speed)

> In Jungle Speed, you must rely on your keen sense of observation and quick reflexes. It requires a steady hand -- which can be hard to maintain during the many fits of maniacal laughter! The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game. Each player is dealt a hand of cards. In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary.

> From the creators of Cyanide & Happiness comes a card game where players compete to finish an awful comic strip.
> The creators said: "Someone on the Internet once told us that making stick figure comics is easy as hell, and that we were ugly and stupid.They were right on all counts. So, after crying for a few hours, we created the Random Comic Generator which since its inception in 2014 has entertained millions with its computer-generated comedy. After a few weeks of playing with the Random Comic Generator, we started to wonder if its hundreds of random panels might lend themselves to a card game, where you compete against your friends to finish a comic with a funny punchline. So we printed out all of the RCG panels and started playing with them." Draw 7 cards. The deck plays the first card, select a Judge to play the second, then everyone selects a third card to create a three panel comic strip. The Judge picks a winner. The game includes a deck of 250 unique panel cards - that’s 15.4 million combinations of comics!

The fact that now you can build right away when you bought a property, gives so much dynamic to the game. No more waiting until you have the whole set, or not having the set because one player refuses to trade. Even with a couple of single properties you can win the game.

> Battle with your opponents and the buzzer in this quick-thinking, fast-paced game of categories. How many famous actors, pizza topping, things that are red, or breeds of dog can you name under pressure? ‘Pinch’ and ‘pass’ category cards differ in that you try to snag pinch cards from other players by shouting out something from the category and you try to get rid of pass cards hot-potato style by saying something from the category. Whoever’s left holding the card when the buzzer goes off reaps the benefit (for pinch cards) or suffering the penalty (for pass cards). First player to the finish line is the winner, but don’t get knocked out for getting caught with too many pass cards! Each player may also call another player out for a head-to-head round. You can only do it once, so make it count!

### [Catan: Explorers & Pirates Expansion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135378/catan-explorers-pirates)

> Catan: Explorers & Pirates is the fourth major expansion for The Settlers of Catan. It includes five scenarios and three missions; some of the scenarios make use of the missions while others do not. This expansion is based on the CATAN base game rules but also contains a number of new game mechanisms. For example, ships are now equipped for expeditions and can be moved freely across the board. In the ships you transport settlers, crews, fish, or spices across the seas. The main goal is to build new outposts on the islands that are still undiscovered and to complete the Council of Catan's missions in the most skillful way possible. Catan: Explorers & Pirates differs from the Catan base game in three main ways. First, instead of having only a single island in the game on which players build and compete for resources, three islands are present. Second, instead of using cities, Catan: Explorers & Pirates allows players to build port settlements. Like cities, port settlements are worth two victory points (VPs), and the number of VPs required to win depends on the scenario. Third, if a player receives no resources during the production roll (other than on a roll of 7), she receives one gold in compensation. The winner is the first one who reaches 17 VPs.

### [The Mind](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind)

> The Mind is more than just a game. It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game. In more detail, the deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete 12, 10, or 8 levels of play with 2, 3, or 4 players. In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc. Collectively you must play these cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold. You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life.

### [Marrakesh](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/342810/marrakesh)

> Compete with other influential families in the city to achieve the most honorable titles through the skillful use of assistants and resources at your disposal. The player who succeeds in doing this best becomes the new "Obermufti" of Marrakesh.
> Marrakesh is played over three rounds, with each round consisting of four turns. On each turn, players simultaneously and secretly choose three colored cylinders from behind their screen. Then, in turn order, they place matching colored assistants on their player board and perform the corresponding action, then all cylinders are placed in the cube tower. Then, in turn order, players select a color and take 1-2 of the cylinders that have passed through the tower (or those that were stuck from a previous round but have now emerged) and place them on their player boards. These cylinders will enhance future actions taken in the same color in future rounds. Actions allow players to gain wealth, which can be traded for influence in the city. Performing various actions also earns bonuses and enhances actions even more as the game proceeds. The player who scores the most points by the end of the game wins.

### [Abalone](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/526/abalone)

> This beautiful and functional board has room for two teams of large marbles. Players take turns pushing the marbles around the board, with the goal of pushing six of the opposing player's marbles off the board. The central idea is that a column of marbles has weight given by the number of marbles in line. Someone will need to push with a heavier group of marbles in order to push the column along that axis. However, with six possible directions, it's difficult to defend yourself perfectly. Also, it's possible to play the game with up to six players when supplemental marble sets are purchased.

### [Nine Men's Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men's_morris)

> The board consists of a grid with twenty-four intersections or points. Each player has nine pieces, or "men", usually coloured black and white. Players try to form 'mills'—three of their own men lined horizontally or vertically—allowing a player to remove an opponent's man from the game. A player wins by reducing the opponent to two pieces (where they could no longer form mills and thus be unable to win), or by leaving them without a legal move.

### [Scrabble](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/320/scrabble)

> In this classic word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.

### [Battleship](https://board-games-galore.fandom.com/wiki/Battleship)

> In this two-person game of strategy, players secretly arrange their ships on a lettered and numbered 10x10 grid and then try to locate and destroy their opponent’s fleet. There are two grids for each player. One grid is used for placing your own vessels and tracking hits made against you, while the second grid is for marking the hits targeted at your opponent. Take turns firing shots by calling out one of the grid’s plot points. If a hit doesn’t strike a ship, it’s considered a miss and pegged with white pieces. If a hit makes contact with a ship, then that strike gets pegged with red. The number of hits each kind of vessel can sustain before it sinks is varied. After some initial exploratory firing, you will likely start to figure out the location of your opponent’s ships and begin to deal the fatal blows. It’s a battle on the high seas!

### [Magic: The Gathering](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/463/magic-gathering)

> In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker—a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you. This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre. Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare. Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection. Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck. Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero. The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game. An important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck. There are over 25,000 different cards from which to build your deck! Cards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used. Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect. Players randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn. Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells. A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called "the stack," provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn. Though traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.
