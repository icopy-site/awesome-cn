### [Why Invest in Application Security?](https://paragonie.com/white-paper/2015-why-invest-application-security) (2015)

**Released**: June 21, 2015

Running a business requires being cost-conscious and minimizing unnecessary spending. The benefits of ensuring in the security of your application are invisible to most companies, so often times they neglect to invest in secure software development as a cost-saving measure. What these companies don't realize is the potential cost (both financial and to brand reputation) a preventable data compromise can incur.

**The average data breach costs millions of dollars in damage.**

Investing more time and personnel to develop secure software is, for most companies, worth it to minimize this unnecessary risk to their bottom line.

Discusses the importance of end-to-end network-layer encryption (HTTPS) as well as secure encryption for data at rest, then introduces the specific cryptography tools that developers should use for specific use cases, whether they use [libsodium](https://pecl.php.net/package/libsodium), [Defuse Security's secure PHP encryption library](https://github.com/defuse/php-encryption), or OpenSSL.

### [The 2018 Guide to Building Secure PHP Software](https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/12/2018-guide-building-secure-php-software) (2017)

**Released**: December 12, 2017

This guide should serve as a complement to the e-book, [PHP: The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com), with a strong emphasis on security and not general PHP programmer topics (e.g. code style).

## Books and ebooks


*Securing PHP: Core Concepts* acts as a guide to some of the most common security terms and provides some examples of them in every day PHP.

### [Using Libsodium in PHP Projects](https://paragonie.com/book/pecl-libsodium)

You shouldn't need a Ph.D in Applied Cryptography to build a secure web application. Enter libsodium, which allows developers to develop fast, secure, and reliable applications without needing to know what a stream cipher even is.

## Useful libraries

### [defuse/php-encryption](https://github.com/defuse/php-encryption)

Symmetric-key encryption library for PHP applications. (**Recommended** over rolling your own!)
